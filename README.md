Todoist API Python wrapper
I know this could have (and has been) done better, but this is really just a project to help me get back into the swing of school.
My old task management program (mixture of C# and Python) is kind of slow and not all that great (it uses Google Tasks), which is why I decided to make
this new one using Todoist. A GUI is also to come, probably in python but I'm undecided at the moment, possibly Java.
